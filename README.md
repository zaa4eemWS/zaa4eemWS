### üë• Team members

- <b>CEO & Back-end Developer</b><br>
[Artem](https://github.com/zaa4eem) our only back-end developer, who is starting to actively learn new things for him. He will be responsible for the entire server part of our rather large project. Creating, deleting and modifying documents in the database is one of his main tasks, he strives to complete it. He also creates concepts, layouts of what the project will look like schematically, and share his findings with the designers, and they already do their job.

- <b>Team Lead & Senior Front-end Developer</b><br>
[Dmytro](https://github.com/chyVacheck) He is the lead Front-end developer, and he and his partners are responsible for the client side of the project. He also contributes to the design of our project, and the last thing he does is develop new ideas for the project.

- <b>Junior Front-end Developer</b><br>
[Eugene](https://github.com/hxrizxnqq) is an integral member of our team who has several different roles. His first major role at the moment is design, he has a good command of Photoshop and knows how to use Figma, for which we are very grateful to him. On the second plan this is layout and Front-end in general, he's not much experienced in this, but this doesn't prevent him from listening carefully, learning and doing, in the future Eugene will obviously be a good Front-end developer. Because of his specific equipment he doesn't have a working microphone and his voice is a big mystery.

- <b>Designer</b><br>
[Lisa](https://github.com/lolligrom) one of our designers and the first and only girl in the team, knows and knows how to use Figma. She also graduated from art school, which makes her an even more valuable designer and team member. Selecting beautiful colors, sizes, shapes, concepts and overall design is what Lisa is responsible for.
