- About our team
We are a novice web development team with little knowledge but a lot of enthusiasm!

- CEO & Back-end Developer
[Artem](https://github.com/zaa4eem) our only back-end developer, who is starting to actively learn new things for him. He will be responsible for the entire server part of our rather large project. Creating, deleting and modifying documents in the database is one of his main tasks, he strives to complete it. He also creates concepts, layouts of what the project will look like schematically, and share his findings with the designers, and they already do their job.
